# Description: This class works in conjunction with a MultiRootAnalyzer instance
# and uses its data for visualization purposes.
#
# Key functionalities:
# 1. (Removed) Static print_tree() method - Tree printing is now handled by Node.print_tree().
# 2. visualize_forest_connections() - The main method for visualizing the forest,
#    displaying each tree structure and the connections between them based on shared nodes.

# Imports
# (No specific imports are listed, but would typically include MultiRootAnalyzer types if type hinting was more extensive)
# from .multi_root_analyzer import BaseMultiRootAnalyzer # Example
